Project Proposal: Analyzing the Hydrogen Atomic Spectrum and the Rydberg Formula

1. Introduction:

In this project, I will analyze the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen to explore quantum energy levels and the Rydberg formula. This project will involve data analysis, data generation, applying quality filters, fitting data with error, and providing explanations for the model fit. The goal is to understand how quantum mechanics predicts the wavelengths of hydrogen's spectral lines and to compare observed data with theoretical predictions.

2. Chosen Phenomenon and Data Source:

The chosen phenomenon is the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom, as observed in its emission spectrum. I will use real data from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database (https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html), specifically the H I (neutral hydrogen) spectrum. The data includes observed wavelengths, upper and lower energy levels, and uncertainties.

3. Equation to Fit Data:

The Rydberg formula predicts the wavelengths of hydrogen's spectral lines:

    1/λ = R_H (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)

where:
- λ is the wavelength,
- R_H is the Rydberg constant,
- n1 and n2 are integers with n2 > n1.

I will fit this formula to the observed data to extract the Rydberg constant and compare it to the accepted value.

4. Data Generation for Testing:

I will generate synthetic data using the Rydberg formula for various transitions (different n1 and n2) to verify the model and fitting procedure.

5. Data Filtering:

- Outlier Removal: Exclude lines with large uncertainties or that deviate significantly from the expected trend.
- Duplicate Data: Remove duplicate entries.
- Quality Flags: Prioritize lines with high measurement accuracy.
- Missing Data Handling: Exclude incomplete entries.

6. Data Fitting with Error:

I will fit the Rydberg formula to the data using Python's scipy.optimize.curve_fit, extracting the best-fit Rydberg constant and its uncertainty from the covariance matrix.

7. Explanation of Model Fit:

I will explain how the Rydberg formula describes the hydrogen spectrum, interpret the fitted Rydberg constant, and evaluate the goodness of fit. I will discuss the physical meaning of the results and any deviations from the model.
